STANDARD EXPECTED IMPLEMENTATION

Need 
    - Weights in the form of a state_dict as well as a string representation of the filepath
    - Images to make inference on in the form of a 640 x 640 x 3 tensor
        (NOTE - WillFlow expects a 3 x 640 x 640 tensor, clean_img takes a 640 x 640 x 3 and
        gets it into a useful state)
    
from detr_utils import WillFlow, clean_img, make_pred

model = WillFlow()
model.load_state_dict(
            torch.load(path_to_state_dict),

# Do whatever tf with pred_s u want
